# What
Encloses text into into a block font based off the [Enclosed Alphanumeric Supplement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enclosed_Alphanumeric_Supplement). A working example can be found at http://enclosify.pycatfacts.com/.

# Why??
It amuses me.

# Requirements
Tornado and python. Use `pip install tornado` to install tornado.

# How
`python enclosify.py` will run it, by default, on port 8889. Browse to your web browser afterwards, enter in the text you want to enclosify, and enclosify will do the rest.
